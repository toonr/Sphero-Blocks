## Welcome to Sphero-Blocks

This is a ScratchX application with custom blocks for the [Sphero robot](http://www.sphero.com/).

## Running the project

Connecting to a device needs to be done through the Chrome application.
However, the [ScratchX page](http://scratchx.org/?url=https://toonr.github.io/Sphero-Blocks/sphero_blocks.js) can be visited without connecting.
